Download the tif data and put the tifs into a directory called `tifs`. Clone this repo. This repo and the `tifs` directory should be located in the same directory.

Tar the tifs into {dataset_key}.tar.gz and put it on SQUID.

Create the mask and put it in the `masks/` directory with the name `mask_{dataset_key}.txt`.

Run `python setup.py`.

Run `python create_R_data.py parameters/parameters_C234.json`,

followed by `python g4spatial.py parameters/parameters_C234.json`.

This will run everything serially.
